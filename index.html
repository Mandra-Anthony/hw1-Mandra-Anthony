    <p>There are three main reasons I love this film. Firstly, it puts you inside the mind of someone who has a serious mental disorder. How he gets the disorder slowly reveals itself throughout the film, but rewatching the film helped me see all the signs properly. And that is another reason why I love this film. I can rewatch it over and over with no problem. There are no dull moments in this movie. Lastly, this is the only other movie besides inception that made me feel a little insane. Why would this be a reason to love a movie? Well, I think putting your mind in a chaotic and unknown space you can grow from it. This movie made me grow as a person, and changed my perspective on mental disorders completely. Overall, this movie is a 10/10, and everyone has to see it.</p> <br>
